    <div>
        <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I am writing to you in hope of obtaining a position in your
            esteemed company. I interest in computer programming and I want to apply for a software engineer.
            I am a bachelor from ZJU in the class 2012 and my major is physics. It does not mean I did not take any
            course about programming. Actually, I studied some kind of program language such as C++, Pascal. When I was
            studying Pascal, I entered the competition. Furthermore, I took courses about router setting and Electrical
            and Electronic Technology so I also learned hardware technology.
            In addition, exercising regularly, I have a healthy body fighting for company. Being a software engineer,
            creative ability is part and parcel. I made a game with VB.
            The enclosed resume outlines my credentials and accomplishments in greater detail. I would welcome an
            opportunity to meet with you for a personal interview.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p> Yours faithfully
            <br>
            Li, Yifan
        </p>
